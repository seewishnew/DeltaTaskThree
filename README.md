## Synopsis
This is a Contact Manager app and is similar to the one you can find in your phone. In fact, it is based on the contact manager app on my phone. Basic functionalities such as adding, editing, deleting and searching are present as of now. 

##Tests
Right now, it is still in debug mode, meaning some bugs are to be expected. 

To add a new contact, click on the menu at the top right corner of the screen.

To edit or delete a contact, hold a contact in the list till the menu pops up asking if you want to edit or delete.

To search for a contact, click on the magnifying glass icon in the toolbar and enter a person's name or phone number. The search result will produce a list of contacts that had something in common with the search string entered.
